django-tastypie
===============

Creating delicious APIs for Django apps since 2010.


Requirements
============

* Python 2.4+
* Django 1.0+
* mimeparse (http://code.google.com/p/mimeparse/)
* lxml (http://codespeak.net/lxml/) if using the XML serializer
* pyyaml (http://pyyaml.org/) if using the YAML serializer


Why tastypie?
=============

You want an API framework that has less magic, very flexible and maps well to
the problem domain.

You want an API framework that doesn't involve overriding a 115+ line
``__call__`` function to assert some control over your API.

You want to support my perceived NIH syndrome, which is less about NIH and more
about trying to help out friends/coworkers.
